# Furry-Removal-Test
When a furry joins your game, this script has the ability to kick them.


What this script simply does is scan your groups, chat messages, accessories, and even game favorites.


This script has been updated as of December 21, 2022, and I'd like you to review it and give it a pull request or issue something on the script.

How exactly does the script work?


1-) Accessories
Q: How do the accessories work?
A: Firstly, about the accessories: They scan it via "MeshId," which means most of the hat or accessory detection is made through SpecialMesh and MeshParts.


2-) In-game messaging
Q: How can you get kicked by certain messages?
A: The way this works is that it analyzes your messages, so in that case, a furry "term" is likely to get you banned. Please be extra careful when chatting certain animal talk, that may get you kicked.


3-) Scanner for Group IDs
Q: So in the module there's a kick?
A: Yes, there is a kick script in the module that checks if the player is associated with the group and informs him that the community he is in is dangerous.


4-) Ban player (userId/username)
Q: Is a player ban necessary?
A: This isn't entirely necessary because the ban only affects a few people, so you can leave it out if you want. Because in the "_main" module, it only bans a few people who make furry UGCs.


5-) FavoritedGames (_main)
Q: How does the Favorite Games feature work?
A: What it does is scan your profile to see if you somehow favorited a certain game that is "furry" related, so to speak. And if it does so, it will kick you out of the game.
Q: Does this represent an HTTP Service API? and could it get patched?
A: Yes, and possibly. Roblox does not trust the HTTP Proxy "roproxy," and it may be removed in the future; if it is removed, I will try to achieve it and add it back.
